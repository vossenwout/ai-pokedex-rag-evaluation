*Archaludon* is a Steel/Dragon type Pokémon introduced in Generation 9.

Evolution of Duraludon, available in part 2 of the Scarlet/Violet DLC, The Indigo Disk.

When in trouble, *Archaludon* extends its normally bent torso, trading some of its mobility for a more stable centre of gravity. While it’s like this, the Pokémon resembles a magnificent steel bridge.
