*Dipplin* is a Grass/Dragon type Pokémon introduced in Generation 9.

Evolution of Applin, released in the Scarlet/Violet DLC, The Teal Mask.

The head and tail appear to belong to two separate creatures; both help each other out from within their shared apple. *Dipplin* coat their apples with syrup produced within their bodies. The layers of fragrant syrup beguile opponents.​
