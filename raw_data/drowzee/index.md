| Crystal | When it twitches its nose, it can tell where someone is sleeping and what that person is dreaming about. |
| Ruby Sapphire | If your nose becomes itchy while you are sleeping, it’s a sure sign that one of these POKéMON is standing above your pillow and trying to eat your dream through your nostrils. |
| FireRed | A descendent of the legendary animal baku, which is said to eat dreams. It is skilled at hypnotism. |
| LeafGreen | Puts enemies to sleep, then eats their dreams. Occasionally gets sick from eating only bad dreams. |
