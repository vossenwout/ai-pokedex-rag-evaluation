| Crystal | In order to prevent their extinction, more people have made an effort to breed these POKéMON. |
| Ruby Sapphire | FARFETCH’D is always seen with a stick from a plant of some sort. Apparently, there are good sticks and bad sticks. This POKéMON has been known to fight with others over sticks. |
| FireRed | It always walks about with a plant stalk clamped in its beak. The stalk is used for building its nest. |
| LeafGreen | The plant stalk it holds is its weapon. The stalk is used like a sword to cut all sorts of things. |
| Emerald | It is always seen with a stick from a plant. Apparently, there are good sticks and bad sticks. This POKéMON occasionally fights with others over choice sticks. |

| Shield | They use a plant stalk as a weapon, but not all of them use it in the same way. Several distinct styles of stalk fighting have been observed. |
| Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl | It can’t live without the stalk it holds. That’s why it defends the stalk from attackers with its life. |
