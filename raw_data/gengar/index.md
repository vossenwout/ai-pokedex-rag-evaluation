### Gengar

|  |  |
| --- | --- |

| Moon | The energy of Mega Evolution awakened it. It sinks into another dimension, where it keeps a patient watch for its chance to attack. |
| Ultra Sun | It tries to take the lives of anyone and everyone. It will even try to curse the Trainer who is its master! |
| Ultra Moon | Mega Evolution has made it possible for Gengar to access other dimensions. Its entire body is brimming with strange power. |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | It can pass through other dimensions and can appear anywhere. It caused a stir one time when it stuck just one leg out of a wall. |
