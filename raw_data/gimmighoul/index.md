*Gimmighoul* is a Ghost type Pokémon introduced in Generation 9.

*Gimmighoul* has two forms - Chest Form and Roaming Form. Chest Form Gimmighoul hide inside sturdy treasure chests - this appears to be the main form, usable in-game.

Roaming Form Gimmighoul carries a single coin on its back, and can be found hiding all over Paldea. However, since they run away as soon as a person approaches, it seems not a single Trainer in Paldea has ever managed to catch one.

Pokédex entries

### Chest Form

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Scarlet | This Pokémon was born inside a treasure chest about 1,500 years ago. It sucks the life-force out of scoundrels who try to steal the treasure. |
| Violet | It lives inside an old treasure chest. Sometimes it gets left in shop corners since no one realizes it’s actually a Pokémon. |

### Roaming Form

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Scarlet | This Pokémon was born from passion that seeped into a coin. It wanders, apparently seeking to return to the treasure chest it once inhabited. |
| Violet | It wanders around, carrying an old coin on its back. It survives by draining the life-force from humans who try to pick up its coin. |
