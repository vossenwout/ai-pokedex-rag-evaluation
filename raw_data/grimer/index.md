### Grimer

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Red Blue | Appears in filthy areas. Thrives by sucking up polluted sludge that is pumped out of factories. |
| Yellow | Made of hardened sludge. It smells too putrid to touch. Even weeds won’t grow in its path. |
| Gold | As it moves, it loses bits of its body from which new GRIMER emerge. This worsens the stench around it. |
| Silver | Wherever GRIMER has passed, so many germs are left behind that no plants will ever grow again. |
| Crystal | When two of these POKéMON’s bodies are combined together, new poisons are created. |
| Ruby | GRIMER’s sludgy and rubbery body can be forced through any opening, however small it may be. This POKéMON enters sewer pipes to drink filthy wastewater. |
| Sapphire | GRIMER emerged from the sludge that settled on a polluted seabed. This POKéMON loves anything filthy. It constantly leaks a horribly germ-infested fluid from all over its body. |
| FireRed | Sludge exposed to X rays from the moon transformed into GRIMER. It loves feeding on filthy things. |
| LeafGreen | Appears in filthy areas. It thrives by sucking up polluted sludge that is pumped out of factories. |
| Emerald | Born from polluted sludge in the sea, GRIMER’s favorite food is anything filthy. They feed on wastewater pumped out from factories. |
| Diamond Pearl Platinum | It was born when sludge in a dirty stream was exposed to the moon’s X-rays. It appears among filth. |
| HeartGold | As it moves, it loses bits of its body, from which new GRIMER emerge. This worsens the stench around it. |

| Moon | It was born from sludge transformed by exposure to X-rays from the moon. When its internal load of germs decreases, it dies. |
| Ultra Sun | It was born from sludge on the ocean floor. In a sterile environment, the germs within its body can’t multiply, and it dies. |
| Ultra Moon | The wastewater coming from factories is clean these days, so Grimer have nothing to eat. They’re said to be on the verge of extinction. |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | Made of congealed sludge. It smells too putrid to touch. Even weeds won’t grow in its path. |

### Alolan Grimer

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Sun | A Grimer, which had been brought in to solve a problem with garbage, developed over time into this form. |
| Moon | The crystals on Grimer’s body are lumps of toxins. If one falls off, lethal poisons leak out. |
| Ultra Sun | There are a hundred or so of them living in Alola’s waste-disposal site. They’re all hard workers who eat a lot of trash. |
| Ultra Moon | Brought to Alola to solve the garbage problem, Grimer seems to relish any and all kinds of trash. |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | It has a passion for trash above all else, speedily digesting it and creating brilliant crystals of sparkling poison. |
