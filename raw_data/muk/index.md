### Muk

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Red Blue | Thickly covered with a filthy, vile sludge. It is so toxic, even its footprints contain poison. |
| Yellow | Smells so awful, it can cause fainting. Through degeneration, it lost its sense of smell. |
| Gold | They love to gather in smelly areas where sludge accumulates, making the stench around them worse. |
| Silver | Its body is made of a powerful poison. Touching it accidentally will cause a fever that requires bed rest. |
| Crystal | As it moves, a very strong poison leaks from it, making the ground there barren for three years. |
| Ruby | From MUK’s body seeps a foul fluid that gives off a nose-bendingly horrible stench. Just one drop of this POKéMON’s body fluid can turn a pool stagnant and rancid. |
| Sapphire | This POKéMON’s favorite food is anything that is repugnantly filthy. In dirty towns where people think nothing of throwing away litter on the streets, MUK are certain to gather. |
| FireRed | It is usually undetectable because it blends in with the ground. Touching it can cause terrible poisoning. |
| LeafGreen | Thickly covered with a filthy, vile sludge. It is so toxic, even its footprints contain poison. |
| Emerald | It prefers warm and humid habitats. In the summertime, the toxic substances in its body intensify, making MUK reek like putrid kitchen garbage. |
| Diamond Pearl Platinum | A toxic fluid seeps from its body. The fluid instantly kills plants and trees on contact. |
| HeartGold | They love to gather in smelly areas where sludge accumulates, making the stench around them worse. |
| SoulSilver | Its body is made of a powerful poison. Touching it accidentally will cause a fever that requires bed rest. |
| Black White | A toxic fluid seeps from its body. The fluid instantly kills plants and trees on contact. |
| Black 2 White 2 | It’s so stinky! Muk’s body contains toxic elements, and any plant will wilt when it passes by. |
| X | They love to gather in smelly areas where sludge accumulates, making the stench around them worse. |
| Y | A toxic fluid seeps from its body. The fluid instantly kills plants and trees on contact. |
| Omega Ruby | From Muk’s body seeps a foul fluid that gives off a nose-bendingly horrible stench. Just one drop of this Pokémon’s body fluid can turn a pool stagnant and rancid. |
| Alpha Sapphire | This Pokémon’s favorite food is anything that is repugnantly filthy. In dirty towns where people think nothing of throwing away litter on the streets, Muk are certain to gather. |
| Sun | The stench it gives off will make your nose scrunch up. Still, there are Muk fans who think that’s a good thing. |
| Moon | After recent environmental improvements, this Pokémon is now hardly seen at all. People speculate that it may go extinct at some point. |
| Ultra Sun | Their food sources have decreased, and their numbers have declined sharply. Sludge ponds are being built to prevent their extinction. |
| Ultra Moon | Because they scatter germs everywhere, they’ve long been targeted for extermination, leading to a steep decline in their population. |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | Smells so awful, it can cause fainting. Through degeneration of its nose, it lost its sense of smell. |
| Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl | A toxic fluid seeps from its body. The fluid kills plants and trees immediately upon contact. |
| Scarlet | It’s thickly covered with a filthy, vile sludge. It is so toxic, even its footprints contain poison. |
| Violet | It’s so stinky! Muk’s body contains toxic elements, and any plant will wilt when it passes by. |

### Alolan Muk

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Sun | The garbage it eats causes continuous chemical changes in its body, which produce its exceedingly vivid coloration. |
| Moon | While it’s unexpectedly quiet and friendly, if it’s not fed any trash for a while, it will smash its Trainer’s furnishings and eat up the fragments. |
| Ultra Sun | There are over a hundred kinds of poison inside its body. Chemical reactions between different poisons are the source of its vitality. |
| Ultra Moon | What look like fangs and claws are actually crystallized poison that will afflict you at a mere touch, so don’t get too close. |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | Muk’s coloration becomes increasingly vivid the more it feasts on its favorite dish—trash. |
