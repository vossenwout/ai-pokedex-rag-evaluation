*Ogerpon* is a Grass type Pokémon introduced in Generation 9.

*Ogerpon* is a new legendary Pokémon, released in the Scarlet/Violet DLC, The Teal Mask. It has four forms depending on its mask: Teal Mask, Wellspring Mask, Hearthflame Mask, and Cornerstone Mask. The latter three forms give it a secondary type of Water, Fire, or Rock respectively.

*Ogerpon* also has a different form when Terastallizing. While in this form its ability changes to Embody Aspect which boosts a particular stat for each form: Teal Mask = Speed, Wellspring Mask = Special Defense, Hearthflame Mask = Attack, Cornerstone Mask = Defense.
