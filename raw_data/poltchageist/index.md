*Poltchageist* is a Grass/Ghost type Pokémon introduced in Generation 9.

Available in The Teal Mask DLC for Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.

*Poltchageist* has a swirl pattern not unlike Sinistea's - but unlike Sinistea, its swirl is not a weakness. After a target is sprinkled with some of *Poltchageist's* powdery body or eats food dusted with it, *Poltchageist* drains their life-force and absorbs it as energy.​
