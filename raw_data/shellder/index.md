Pokédex entries

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Red Blue | Its hard shell repels any kind of attack. It is vulnerable only when its shell is open. |
| Yellow | The shell can withstand any attack. However, when it is open, the tender body is exposed. |
| Gold | It swims facing backward by opening and closing its two-piece shell. It is surprisingly fast. |
| Silver | Grains of sand trapped in its shells mix with its body fluids to form beautiful pearls. |
| Crystal | Clamping on to an opponent reveals its vulnerable parts, so it uses this move only as a last resort. |
| Ruby Sapphire | At night, this POKéMON uses its broad tongue to burrow a hole in the seafloor sand and then sleep in it. While it is sleeping, SHELLDER closes its shell, but leaves its tongue hanging out. |
| FireRed | It is encased in a shell that is harder than diamond. Inside, however, it is surprisingly tender. |
| LeafGreen | Its hard shell repels any kind of attack. It is vulnerable only when its shell is open. |
| Emerald | At night, it burrows a hole in the seafloor with its broad tongue to make a place to sleep. While asleep, it closes its shell, but leaves its tongue hanging out. |
| Diamond Pearl Platinum | It swims backward by opening and closing its two shells. Its large tongue is always kept hanging out. |
| HeartGold | It swims facing backward by opening and closing its two-piece shell. It is surprisingly fast. |
| SoulSilver | Grains of sand trapped in its shells mix with its body fluids to form beautiful pearls. |
| Black White Black 2 White 2 | It swims backward by opening and closing its two shells. Its large tongue is always kept hanging out. |
| X | Its hard shell repels any kind of attack. It is vulnerable only when its shell is open. |
| Y | Clamping on to an opponent reveals its vulnerable parts, so it uses this move only as a last resort. |
| Omega Ruby Alpha Sapphire | At night, this Pokémon uses its broad tongue to burrow a hole in the seafloor sand and then sleep in it. While it is sleeping, Shellder closes its shell, but leaves its tongue hanging out. |
| Sun | The hardness of its shell surpasses the hardness of a diamond. In days gone by, people used the shells to make shields. |
| Moon | This Pokémon’s tongue is always hanging out. It uses its tongue with great dexterity to dig up sand from the seabed in its search for food. |
| Ultra Sun | The sand that accumulates inside its shell eventually becomes a pearl. But the pearl gets in the way, so it spits it out and discards it. |
| Ultra Moon | Even when its shell is closed, its tongue still hangs out. If you give its tongue a good yank, the shock will cause Shellder to open its shell. |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | The shell can withstand any attack. However, when it is open, the tender body is exposed. |
| Sword | It swims facing backward by opening and closing its two-piece shell. It is surprisingly fast. |
| Shield | Its hard shell repels any kind of attack. It is vulnerable only when its shell is open. |
| Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl | It swims backward by opening and closing its two shells. Its large tongue is always kept hanging out. |
| Scarlet | It is encased in a shell that is harder than diamond. Inside, however, it is surprisingly tender. |
| Violet | Clamping on to an opponent reveals its vulnerable parts, so it uses this move only as a last resort. |
