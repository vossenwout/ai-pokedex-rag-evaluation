Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with it in their bed. |\n| Sword | Its melodious cries are actually warnings. Fletchling will mercilessly peck at anything that enters its territory. |\n| Shield | When this Pokémon gets excited, its body temperature increases sharply. If you touch a Fletchling with bare hands, you might get burned. |\n| Scarlet | This Pokémon is normally calm, but once it enters battle, its hormonal balance changes and it becomes aggressive. |\n| Violet | Fletchling can be found in both rural and urban areas.

Rotten seaweed is its main food source. |\n| Ultra Moon | It’s not good at swimming, so it clings to the seaweed. In the Alola region, it’s often found near Dhelmise. |\n| Sword | It drifts in the ocean, blending in with floating seaweed. When other Pokémon come to feast on the seaweed, Skrelp feasts on them instead. |\n| Shield | Skrelp looks like a piece of rotten seaweed, so it can blend in with seaweed drifting on the ocean and avoid being detected by enemies. |\n| Scarlet | Skrelp evades its enemies by hiding amid drifting seaweed. It eats rotten seaweed to create its poison. |\n| Violet | This Pokémon is a poor swimmer.

It has large, blade-like forearms, a pair of wings on its back, and it stands on two clawed feet. Its head is topped with a pointed crest. *Scyther's* design is primarily inspired by a praying mantis.  \n*Scyther* is unusual in that it has two evolutions spread across different generations. From Gold/Silver onward it can evolve into Scizor, and in Legends: Arceus a new evolution Kleavor was introduced. Each evolution changes its type, replacing Flying with Steel and Rock respectively. All three Pokémon also have the same base stat total of 500, however the distribution between the individual stats (Attack, Defense and so on) changes around.  \nScyther  \n![Scyther artwork by Ken Sugimori](https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/scyther.jpg)  \nAdditional artwork  \nPokédex data\n------------  \n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| National № | **0123** |\n| Type | Bug Flying |\n| Species | Mantis Pokémon |\n| Height | 1.5m (4′11″) |\n| Weight | 56.0kg (123.5lbs) |\n| Abilities | 1.

Its body consists of three main parts: the torso, the abdomen and the head. It stands on two legs and has a pair of small wings located on its back which are used to control its body temperature, rather than flying. *Scizor's* habitat is lush and vast where it can reside with the rest of the swarm.  \n*Scizor* evolves from the Bug/Flying type Scyther, thus losing its Flying type upon evolution - a rare occurrence for Pokémon.  \n*Scizor* has a Mega Evolution, available in Generation 6 games and Pokémon Go.  \nScizor\nMega Scizor  \n![Scizor artwork by Ken Sugimori](https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/scizor.jpg)  \nAdditional artwork  \nPokédex data\n------------  \n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| National № | **0212** |\n| Type | Bug Steel |\n| Species | Pincer Pokémon |\n| Height | 1.8m (5′11″) |\n| Weight | 118.0kg (260.1lbs) |\n| Abilities | 1.
